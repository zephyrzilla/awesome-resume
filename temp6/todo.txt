To-do and notes:  HTML5 Player
Last updated: June 2013, Tim Mickel 

To do:
    -Implement volume control for playSound (it's working for notes and drums,
     but the way I'm preloading the sample data for playSound means changing the volume
     mid-play is a little more tricky.  Perhaps use a GainNode per sprite?) 
     Also need volume/tempo watchers.
    
    -Cloning
        This is potentially easy; duplicate the object using deep copy on clone.
        Then remove the object from runtime.sprites on self-destruct - be careful of mem. leak
    
    -Procedures
    
    -Trigger hats (e.g. When Scene Starts?)

    -SVGs/Clicks/Correct collisions and bounce
     (see Chromium bug https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=249037).
    
    -Cloud variables/Scratch 2.0 API calls
  
    -List watchers
    
    -Implement sliders via drawing instead of <input type="range" />
    
    -Graphic effects
        Some are simple to implement in canvas (ghost, brightness, etc.)
        Potentially use CSS filters (CSS3 hue-rotate looks promising)

    -Sound input, camera input


Performance considerations:
    -Touching, touching color, color touching color can definitely be improved

Known bugs:
    -Touching color, color touching color is currently finicky
    -"Keep on stage" / "Bounce on edge" do not match flash player; need to consider transparency
    -Experimental touch support for iPad was put in - this needs to be played with especially for non-iOS.
